index.text=Car rental involves the provision of passenger transportation services. The machine is transferred to the "temporary possession" of the client. Car rental always assumes that the client has a valid driver\u2019s license of the corresponding category. The difference between a car\u2019s arena and a taxi is that you pay for a mileage in a taxi, and in the case of a rental, you take a car for a specific time for several hours, and pay for that particular time. An agreement is concluded between a company and an individual or legal entity (another company, organization). Typically, customers apply for a car rental service at Rentcar.my in cases where they need to: meet guests at the airport or train station to arrange transport escort of any event, transport guests, etc. organize a wedding procession to implement our own excursion program in Belarus and even abroad. The advantages of a rental service include its convenience, and also, the client does not need to worry about car maintenance. Of course, the transport company incurs all associated costs (fuel, parking).
